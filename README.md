## Abstract

This project covers the use of static code analysis, dynamic code analysis and fuzzing techniques with the purpose of finding vulnerabilities in binary programs. In order to demonstrate how effective its use can be. The following steps has been performed:
1. Find the software to be studied.
2. Perform static code analysis, dynamic code analysis and fuzzing over
this software.
3. Analyze the generated reports.
